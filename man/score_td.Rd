\title{Compute the number of large tandem duplication (TDplus).}
\usage{
score_td(segments)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A \code{GRanges} object containing the segments, their copy number and copy number types.}
}
\value{
A list of integer containing the TDplus score (\code{"TDplus"}) and the small TD score (\code{"TD"}).
}
\description{
Compute the number of large tandem duplication (TDplus).
}
\details{
Procedure based on the paper from Popova et al., Cancer Res 2016 (PMID: 26787835). The TDplus
score is defined as the number of regions larger than 1Mb but smaller or equal to 10Mb with a gain of one
or two copies (\code{cntype.gain} in the field \code{cn.subtype}). This score was linked to CDK12-deficient
tumors. They also identified as second category of tandem duplication whose size is smaller or equal than
1Mb and around 300Kb but could not link it to a phenotype. Note that due to its resolution the Oncoscan assay
will most likely miss this second category. Nonetheless it is reported by the function.
