\description{
Trim LOH segments with respect to loss segments.
}
\details{
LOH segments completely contained within (or equal to)  a copy loss segment are deleted.
LOH segments partially overlapping (on one end only) with a copy loss segment are trimmed to
remove the overlap. If a copy loss segment is completely contained within (but not equal to) a LOH
segment, then nothing is done; the overlap remains.
