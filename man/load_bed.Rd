\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Path to the CNV file.}

\item{gender}{Character to indicate whether the sample is male ("M") or female ("F").}
}

}
\description{
Load a CNV file in a BED-like format.
}
\details{
The file is expected to contain the following columns: chromosome name, segment start, segment end,
copy number. An fifth column with the copy number type is optional and if present should contain the values
"Gain", "Loss" or "LOH".
If the gender is not specified, then the segments on the sexual chromosomes (X and Y) are dropped as the
copy number type cannot be determined for those.
